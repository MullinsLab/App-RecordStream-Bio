    recs-fromfasta --oneline < seqs.fasta           \
        | recs-grep '{{id}} =~ /\b(POL|GAG)\b/i'    \
        | recs-tocsv -k id,sequence

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::RecordStream::Bio is a collection of record-handling tools related to
biology built upon the excellent L<App::RecordStream>.

The operations themselves are written as classes, but you'll almost always use
them via their command line wrappers within a larger record stream pipeline.
