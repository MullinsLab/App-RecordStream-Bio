=head1 USAGE

    Usage: recs-tofasta <options> [files]
       Outputs a FASTA-formatted sequence for each record.
    
       By default the keys "id", "description", and "sequence" are used to build the
       FASTA format. These defaults match up with what recs-fromfasta produces. The
       special key name "NONE" may be used to indicate that no key should be used,
       disabling the defaults. Note that specifying NONE for --id will cause any --
       description to appear with a space between it and the line's ">", unless --
       passthru is also used.
    
    Arguments:
       --id|-i <keyspec>            Record field to use for the sequence id
       --description|-d <keyspec>   Record field to use for the sequence description
       --sequence|-s <keyspec>      Record field to use for the sequence itself
       --width|w <#>                Format sequence blocks to # characters wide
       --oneline                    Format sequences on a single long line
       --passthru                   Pass through nucleotides unformatted
       --filename-key|fk <keyspec>  Add a key with the source filename (if no
                                    filename is applicable will put NONE)
    
      Help Options:
          --help-all       Output all help for this script
          --help           This help screen
          --help-keys      Help on keygroups and keyspecs
          --help-keyspecs  Help on keyspecs, a way to index deeply and with regexes
    
    Examples:
      # Remove gaps from a fasta file
      recs-fromfasta seqs.fa | recs-xform '{{sequence}} =~ s/-//g' | recs-tofasta > seqs-nogaps.fa
