=head1 USAGE

    Usage: recs fromgff3 <args> [<files>]
       Each line of input (or lines of <files>) is parsed as a GFF3 (General Feature
       Format version 3) formatted record to produce a recs output record.
    
       The output records will contain the following fields:
    
          seq_id source type start end score strand phase attributes
    
       Additional feature attributes are parsed into the "attributes" key, which is
       a hash keyed by the attribute name. The values are arrays.
    
       Refer to the GFF3 spec for field details:
