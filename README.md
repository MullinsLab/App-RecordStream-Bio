# NAME

App::RecordStream::Bio - A collection of record-handling tools related to biology

# SYNOPSIS

    # Turn a FASTA into a CSV after filtering for sequence names containing the
    # words POL or GAG.
    recs-fromfasta --oneline < seqs.fasta           \
        | recs-grep '{{id}} =~ /\b(POL|GAG)\b/i'    \
        | recs-tocsv -k id,sequence
    

    # Filter gaps from sequences
    recs-fromfasta seqs.fasta \
        | recs-xform '{{seq}} =~ s/-//g' \
        | recs-tofasta > seqs-nogaps.fasta

# DESCRIPTION

App::RecordStream::Bio is a collection of record-handling tools related to
biology built upon the excellent [App::RecordStream](http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::RecordStream).

The operations themselves are written as classes, but you'll almost always use
them via their command line wrappers within a larger record stream pipeline.
