    - BACKWARDS INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: recs-fromfasta now splits the sequence
      name into id and description on the first space.  If you were previously
      using the "id" key, you'll want to start using the "name" key.  I doubt
      anyone is using this but me, though. :)

    - Added recs-tofasta for a quick way to get fasta back out after munging,
      filtering, etc.
